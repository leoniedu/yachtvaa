\title{Compute bearing from projected coordinates}
\usage{
compute_bearing(x1, y1, x2, y2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1, y1}{Start point coordinates (easting, northing in meters).}

\item{x2, y2}{End point coordinates (easting, northing in meters).}
}
\value{
Numeric bearing in degrees [0, 360).
}
\description{
Calculates the bearing (azimuth) from point (x1, y1) to point (x2, y2)
in projected coordinates. Returns degrees clockwise from North (0-360).
}
