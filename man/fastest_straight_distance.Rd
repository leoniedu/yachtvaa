\title{Fastest straight-line distance per athlete}
\usage{
fastest_straight_distance(
  sf_points,
  athlete_col,
  time_col,
  distance_m = 500,
  max_gap = 20,
  min_time = NULL,
  max_speed_kmh = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf_points}{An sf object with POINT geometry in a projected CRS
(units in meters).}

\item{athlete_col}{Character name of the column identifying athletes.}

\item{time_col}{Character name of the POSIXct timestamp column.}

\item{distance_m}{Numeric vector of target distances in meters.
Defaults to 500.}

\item{max_gap}{Maximum time gap (seconds) before splitting a track into
separate segments. Default 20.}

\item{min_time}{Minimum elapsed time (seconds) for a valid segment, or
NULL for no filter.}

\item{max_speed_kmh}{Maximum plausible speed in km/h. Default Inf.}
}
\value{
A data.table with one row per athlete per distance, containing:
\code{distance_m_target}, \code{predicted_time_sec}, \code{avg_speed_mps},
\code{avg_speed_kmh}, \code{bearing_deg}, \code{start_time}, \code{end_time},
\code{straight_distance_m}, \code{cumulative_distance_m}, \code{sinuosity},
\code{start_x}, \code{start_y}, \code{end_x}, \code{end_y}.
Returns an empty data.table if no valid segments are found.
}
\description{
For each athlete in the input sf points, finds the segment where the
predicted time to cover \code{distance_m} meters in a straight line is
minimized. Supports multiple target distances in a single call.
}
\details{
Tracks are split into continuous segments when consecutive timestamps
differ by more than \code{max_gap} seconds.
