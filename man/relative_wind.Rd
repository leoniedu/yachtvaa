\title{Compute relative wind angle and classification}
\usage{
relative_wind(vessel_bearing, wind_direction, wind_speed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{vessel_bearing}{Numeric vector of vessel headings in degrees [0, 360).}

\item{wind_direction}{Numeric vector of wind directions (FROM) in degrees.}

\item{wind_speed}{Optional numeric vector of wind speeds. When zero, the
classification is \code{"calm"}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{wind_angle_deg} and \code{wind_class}.
}
\description{
Given a vessel bearing and meteorological wind direction (FROM convention),
computes the relative angle and classifies wind as headwind, tailwind, or
crosswind. When \code{wind_speed} is provided and equals zero, the class is
set to \code{"calm"} regardless of direction.
